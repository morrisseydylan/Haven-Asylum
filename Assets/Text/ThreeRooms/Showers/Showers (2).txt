Keith: Damn, why's it so cloudy in here? You'd think there was someone still using this place!

Rebecca: Looks like it's coming from that open vent over there!

Andrea: That... doesn't seem right... shouldn't all the power be turned off in this place by now? Why would the AC still be working?

Nick: There is absolutely no way that the vent should still be running, that would have been one of the first things they did before the demo started. 

Keith: Whatever it is, it sure as hell doesn't smell like water or nothing

Andrea: No Keith's definitely right, that's not water... I mean it's kinda obvious but there's more to this place. 

Keith: I don't really believe in all that bullshit. 

Andrea: Doesn't matter if you believe or not, it's still really wild and people actually do some really wild shit in the name of these candles or whatever.

Rebecca: Wait, there's a note here...

Rebecca: ...

Rebecca: ...It has all of our names scribbled on it. But I can't make out anything else. It's unintelligible.

Rebecca: I don't get it... 

Keith: Neither do I, but I don't like what I CAN read.

Andrea: Keith, did you put this here?

Keith: Why would I? HOW could I?

Andrea: I know...
