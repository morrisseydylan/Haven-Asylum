Keith: Whatever. Besides, I know something really fun we could do later.

Rebecca: Wait, you're not actually thinking about going to that asylum, are you?

Keith: You know it's getting demolished soon. It'll be our last chance to explore it!

Andrea: What are you guys talking about?

Keith: I heard there's this old building on the outskirts of town that's getting demolished this week. I thought it'd be cool to see what it's like to explore it!

Andrea: Nope. No way.

Rebecca: I am a little curious... Aren't you?
[CHOICE]It sounds dangerous.
[CHOICE]It's just an old building.
