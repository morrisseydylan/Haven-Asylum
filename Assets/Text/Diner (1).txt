Andrea: WHAT??? I FAILED MY CALCULUS EXAM!?

Andrea: ...

Andrea: ...I studied so hard for it...

Keith: Nah, I had Dr. Pucket last year. His exams were always whack. He was always going off on tangents during lectures...

Rebecca: Yeah, don't beat yourself up over it. Besides, it's spring break now! We don't have to think about any of that stuff for a while.

Andrea: I suppose you're right.

Keith: Nick, are you really still studying!? What do you even need to prepare for?

Nick: Oh, uh... you know... I just don't want to get behind on anything.

Rebecca: Oh, come on! %PLAYER%, you're also doing engineering, right? Do you really need to study over spring break?
[CHOICE 1] Nick can do what he thinks is best!
[CHOICE 2] It is a bit much.

[RESPONSE 1] Keith: Whatever. Besides, I know something really fun we could do later.

[RESPONSE 2] Keith: Exactly! You should give it a rest. Besides, I know something really fun we could do later.

Rebecca: Wait, you're not actually thinking about going to that asylum, are you?

Keith: You know it's getting demolished soon. It'll be our last chance to explore it!

Andrea: What are you guys talking about?

Keith: I heard there's this old building on the outskirts of town that's getting demolished this week. I thought it'd be cool to see what it's like to explore it!

[OBJECT 1]

Andrea: ...

Andrea: "In 1982, amidst accusations of suspicious activity and illegal and dangerous experimentation being carried out by asylum staff and benefactors, the asylum was forced to close its doors."

Andrea: ...

Andrea: Nope. No way.

Rebecca: I am a little curious... Aren't you?
[CHOICE 1] It's just an old building.
[CHOICE 2] It sounds dangerous.

Nick: There's no way the building could be safe. We could get hurt.

Keith: Sure, but we could also find something really cool! And it would be good for you to get out of your shell.

Nick: Can we go back to eating, please?

Keith: Just saying, it could be fun to poke around...
