Keith: Nice job %PLAYER%. Didn't think we'd actually find anything. 

Nick: Was kinda hoping we wouldn't. 

Andrea: You're finding every reason to remind us that you don't wanna be here.

Nick: It's not like I'm saying this in a Denny's or something! This is a crazy asylum where people were killed! Yes, killed! I know there isn't anyone there to murder us or whatever but there are police that do checks out here, contractors, and... I don't know coyotes! 

Rebecca: If you were so afraid of the coyotes why didn't you tell us to begin with? I have coyote repellent at home I think, but I might almost be out -

Nick: NOT THE POINT! 

Andrea: Ok, we hear you but we don't really have the same concerns. We even told you on the way here that it's completely cleared out. I mean you could've just not come. 

Nick: Do you just want me to leave right now because I will. 

Keith: Not with the golf cart. We still need a way back.

Nick: I'll walk and order a ride or something. At this point it seems like you all just want me to leave either way.
[CHOICE 1] Convince Nick to join.
[CHOICE 2] Let Nick leave.

[RESPONSE 2] Rebecca: We'll be sure to give them your address so you can get the tour from home!

[RESPONSE 2] Nick: BYE!
